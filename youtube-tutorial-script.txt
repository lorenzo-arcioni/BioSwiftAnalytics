Welcome to this tutorial on how to use our Jupyter notebooks for analyzing annotation results!

If you're working in the field of biology or bioinformatics, you know that analyzing annotation data can be a challenging task. 
That's why we've created a set of Jupyter notebooks that can help you streamline the analysis process and generate meaningful insights from your annotation results.

Our notebooks are built on top of Python and several popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
We have created four notebooks, each with a specific focus:

    The first notebook is designed for parsing the TSV files generated by annotation software for homology searches, such as BLAST or Diamond.

    The second notebook is for creating Venn diagrams that highlight the hits obtained in various protein databases, such as NR, Trembl, and Swissprot.

    The third notebook is for generating a table with hit rates. This notebook requires the input FASTA file of the annotation.

    The fourth notebook is for producing a readable summary of annotations.

Using our notebooks is easy. For example, if you want to analyze the results of a homology search, you'll need to have a TSV file with the search results. 
Simply open our first notebook, load your TSV file, and follow the instructions to clean and process your data. 
The notebook will guide you through the process of generating various types of plots and visualizations that can help you understand the distribution 
and characteristics of your hits.
If you're interested in creating a Venn diagram to compare the hits obtained in different protein databases, you can use our second notebook. 
This notebook will walk you through the process of loading and merging the annotation files, and generating a Venn diagram that shows the overlapping hits.

The third notebook is designed for calculating hit rates, which can be useful for evaluating the quality and specificity of your annotation results. 
To use this notebook, you'll need to have a set of annotated sequences in FASTA format, as well as a set of protein sequences that you used as a 
reference for your annotation. The notebook will guide you through the process of calculating hit rates and generating a table that summarizes the results.
Finally, our fourth notebook is for producing a summary of annotations. This notebook is useful for creating a concise and readable 
report of your annotation results, which can be helpful for communicating your findings to others.

By using our Jupyter notebooks, you can save a lot of time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual data processing and analysis. 
You can also customize the notebooks to fit your specific needs, by modifying the code and adding new functionality.

So, whether you're a biologist, a bioinformatician, or anyone interested in analyzing annotation data, 
our Jupyter notebooks are a great tool to have in your toolkit. We hope you find this tutorial helpful, and we encourage you to try our notebooks 
and provide us with feedback and suggestions for improvement. 

Thanks for watching!
