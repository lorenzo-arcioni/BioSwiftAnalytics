# Biological Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the Biological Data Analysis repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to simplify the analysis of biological data.

## Notebook Descriptions

### 1. Annotation Rate: Hit Rate Comparison

The "Annotation Rate: Hit Rate Comparison" notebook generates a table with hit percentages for protein sequences on various protein databases. This analysis helps assess the coverage and specificity of protein databases, aiding in database selection for specific analyses.

### 2. Annotation Report: Multi-database Annotation Summary

The "Annotation Report: Multi-database Annotation Summary" notebook generates a comprehensive report based on annotation results obtained from tools like BLAST or Diamond. Users can interactively visualize and analyze their annotation results, including detailed statistics and data visualizations.

### 3. Visualizing Insights: A Jupyter Notebook for Enhanced Annotation Result Interpretation

These Jupyter Notebooks support the analysis of homology-based annotation results generated by BLAST or Diamond annotation software. Users can generate informative graphs and reports to aid in the interpretation of tabular annotation files obtained during the annotation process.

### 4. Assembly Completeness Analysis for Aedes Genome Assembly

The "Assembly Completeness Analysis for Aedes Genome Assembly" notebook focuses on visualizing and comparing the assembly completeness of genomes from different datasets using bar charts. It utilizes libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and more for data analysis and visualization.

### 5. Overlap Explorer: A Jupyter Notebook for Comparing Annotation Results Across Databases Using Venn Diagrams

The "Overlap Explorer" notebook enables the interpretation of tab-separated value (TSV) files from annotation software (BLAST/Diamond) and facilitates the generation of Venn diagrams to visualize the distribution of hits in different databases.

# Using Jupyter Lab on Binder: File Upload and HPC Cluster File Transfer

To use these notebooks, it is encouraged to utilize the Jupyter Lab environment on Binder. You can access the interactive notebooks by clicking the following link: [Open in Binder](insert_your_binder_link_here).

Whether you're an experienced bioinformatician or new to the field, these notebooks are essential tools for conducting homology-based annotation analysis and generating informative plots and reports for your research.

This mini-guide provides instructions on how to utilize the Jupyter Lab environment on Binder for file management, including uploading files from your local filesystem and downloading files from a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster using the `scp` command.

## Uploading Files from Your Local Filesystem

1. **Click on the Binder Link**: Start by clicking on the Binder link provided in the repository's README. This will launch a virtual Jupyter Lab environment in your web browser.

2. **Access Jupyter Lab**: Once the Jupyter Lab environment is loaded, you will have access to a Jupyter Lab interface.

3. **Upload Files**:
    - In the Jupyter Lab interface, navigate to the directory where you want to upload files.
    - Click on the "Upload Files" button.
    - Select the files you wish to upload from your local filesystem.
    - The selected files will be uploaded to the chosen directory in your Jupyter Lab environment.

## Transferring Files from an HPC Cluster Using `scp`

1. **Access Jupyter Lab on Binder**: Follow the steps mentioned above to launch Jupyter Lab on Binder.

2. **Open a Terminal in Jupyter Lab**:
    - In Jupyter Lab, click on "File" in the top menu.
    - Select "New" and then choose "Terminal."
    - This will open a terminal window within Jupyter Lab.

3. **Use `scp` Command for File Transfer**:
    - To transfer files from an HPC cluster to your Jupyter Lab environment, use the `scp` command.
    - The basic syntax for copying a file from a remote server to your Jupyter Lab environment is as follows:
      ```bash
      scp username@remote_server:/path/to/remote/file ./files/
      ```
      Replace `username`, `remote_server`, `/path/to/remote/file`, and `./files/` with the appropriate values.
    
4. **Download Files from HPC to Jupyter Lab**:
    - Execute the `scp` command in the Jupyter Lab terminal, and it will copy the file from the HPC cluster to your Jupyter Lab environment.
    
5. **Access Your Downloaded Files**:
    - Once the file transfer is complete, you can access and work with the downloaded files within Jupyter Lab.

Please note that for using `scp`, you need to have appropriate access and credentials to the remote HPC cluster. Ensure that you replace placeholders in the `scp` command with actual values relevant to your setup.

With these steps, you can seamlessly manage files, upload from your local filesystem, and transfer files to and from an HPC cluster while working in the Jupyter Lab environment on Binder.


Happy analyzing!
